        In order to be able to use the app, you need to set your Bluesky
        credentials here. These are stored encrypted locally in the app-data
        folder.

        Also, you need to set the path to your backup folder. This is the folder
        where your backups and drafts will be stored. Example:
        /Users/username/Documents/BskyBackup

          Be careful! This app is still a work in progress. Only use an account
          you are ok with losing data on if something goes wrong.
